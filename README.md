# Design Patterns in C++

This repository is a **Low-Level Design (LLD) reference** for implementing **Design Patterns in C++**.
It contains practical, working examples of commonly used patterns that help in writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

##  What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are **proven solutions to common software design problems**.
They provide a **template or blueprint** for solving recurring issues in object-oriented software development without reinventing the wheel.

In **LLD (Low-Level Design)**, design patterns are heavily used to structure code, ensure scalability, and handle extensibility in real-world projects.

##  Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are broadly classified into three categories:

### 1. **Creational Patterns**

Focus on **object creation mechanisms**. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created.
Examples:

* Factory Pattern
* Abstract Factory
* Singleton
* Builder
* Prototype

### 2. **Structural Patterns**

Focus on **class and object composition**. They help ensure that different parts of a system fit together efficiently.
Examples:

* Adapter
* Composite
* Proxy
* Flyweight
* Facade
* Bridge
* Decorator

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**

Focus on **object interaction and responsibility distribution**.
Examples:

* Strategy
* Observer
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* State
* Mediator
* Visitor
* Template Method
* Interpreter
* Memento

##  Repository Purpose

This repo aims to:

* Provide **C++ implementations** of all major design patterns.
* Help in **LLD interview preparation** with practical examples.
* Act as a **quick reference guide** for developers.
* Demonstrate how patterns solve real-world problems.

## How This Repo Helps You

* If you’re preparing for **system design or LLD interviews**, this repo shows how to implement patterns in C++.
* If you’re a learner, you’ll understand **when and why** to use a particular pattern.
* If you’re a developer, you can use these snippets as **reference implementations** in your projects.
